# Hotel Recommendation System

Welcome to my Hotel Recommendation System project! This system aims to help users discover the perfect hotel for their next trip based on their preferences or by similarity to a hotel they already like.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Input your preferences, and our system will recommend hotels that match your criteria.
- **Similar Hotel Finder**: If you already have a favorite hotel, find similar ones instantly.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Simple user interface makes it effortless to find your ideal hotel.

## How It Works

Our system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze hotel descriptions and user preferences. Here's how it works:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We clean and preprocess hotel data, extracting relevant features such as location, amenities, and reviews.
2. **User Input Processing**: Users can provide their preferences or specify a hotel they like.
3. **Textual Similarity**: We compute similarity scores between hotels based on descriptions and user preferences.
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Based on similarity scores and user criteria, we generate personalized hotel recommendations.
5. **User Interface**: Recommendations are presented in an intuitive interface for easy exploration.

## Usage

To use our Hotel Recommendation System, simply follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (`pandas`, `numpy`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, etc.).
3. Run the main script (`hotel_recommendation.py`) and follow the prompts.

## Example

Here's a quick example of how you can use our system:

```python
from hotel_recommendation import recommender

# Provide user preferences
location = "Paris"
description = "Romantic getaway with a view"

# Get personalized recommendations
recommendations = recommender(data, location, description)

print(recommendations)
